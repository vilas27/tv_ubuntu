# Ubuntu 17.10 Setup

I created this script in order to install and configure everything that is necessary for me to work.

This from a clean installation of Ubuntu 17.10, of course it is possible to use this at any time. I have this divided into modules/folders, this is in several scripts so it is easier to install and configure just one thing.
